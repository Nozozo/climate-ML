Action synthesizes them.&quot; - Assata Shakur</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The &quot;Climate Stalin&quot; community seeks to create a Five-Year Plan plan to reverse climate change. The Marxist-Leninist principles of collectivization and democratic centralism have been proven to work in the face of the only other comparable threats in human history. To confront the problem of ecological catastrophe, we must call on these organizational frameworks again, enlisting every available principled Marxist-Leninist to do the research, organizing and other work necessary to facilitate this project. </p><div class='md-toc' mdtype='toc'><p class="md-toc-content"><span class="md-toc-item md-toc-h1" data-ref="n0"><a class="md-toc-inner" style="" href="#header-n0">Table of Contents</a></span><span class="md-toc-item md-toc-h2" data-ref="n115"><a class="md-toc-inner" style="" href="#header-n115">The Existential Threats of Climate Change</a></span><span class="md-toc-item md-toc-h2" data-ref="n33"><a class="md-toc-inner" style="" href="#header-n33">How Marxism-Leninism has solved a Previous Existential Threat</a></span><span class="md-toc-item md-toc-h2" data-ref="n48"><a class="md-toc-inner" style="" href="#header-n48">A Vision of Life Beyond Climate Change</a></span><span class="md-toc-item md-toc-h2" data-ref="n65"><a class="md-toc-inner" style="" href="#header-n65">Our Assumptions</a></span><span class="md-toc-item md-toc-h2" data-ref="n83"><a class="md-toc-inner" style="" href="#header-n83">The Plan for the Mitigation and Reversal of Climate Change</a></span><span class="md-toc-item md-toc-h2" data-ref="n100"><a class="md-toc-inner" style="" href="#header-n100">An Appeal For Help</a></span></p></div><blockquote><p>&quot;Global finance capital has no dedication to human and social values. Capitalism has no loyalty to anything but itself&quot; - Michael Parenti</p></blockquote><h2><a name='header-n115' class='md-header-anchor '></a>The Existential Threats of Climate Change</h2><p>Capitalism-driven climate change is the greatest existential threat human society has ever faced. Crop yields are expected to fall significantly for each degree of warming the world experiences. Large, densely populated areas of the world, especially in the global south, will be rendered uninhabitable. In North America, droughts will be longer and more severe, and wildfires will continue to grow in intensity and frequency. Sea-level rise will displace billions of people, and the ensuing refugee crisis will feed into fascist ideology and their perverse narratives of invasion. and wildfires will continue to grow in intensity and frequency. As a consequence of continued imperialism and colonialism, the costs of climate change will fall disproportionately on those who did the least to cause it. The Global South will be the epicenter for the political, economic and social catastrophes that a warming world will unleash, but none of us will be immune. Armed conflict around the world will be intensified. Our daily lives will, slowly but inevitably, be filled with chaos, hunger, and violence as basic services - internet, electricity, gasoline, food, water - break down under the strain of environmental degradation. The simplistic appeal of white supremacy and fascism, coupled with increased chaos, will lead to a surge of fascist organizing and terror. The problem is global in scope, and no one can escape it.</p><p>Bourgeois liberal solutions will not solve this problem because they cannot address the root cause of climate change: the capitalist&#39;s need to place profit above all other considerations, including the lives of billions of people. Furthermore, previous attempts at liberal solutions have failed, as will any future liberal solutions. Despite the incremental and modest nature of the Paris Accords and given that they would merely mitigate some of the worst climate outcomes, none of the biggest contributors to climate change are on track to meet their Paris committments.</p><p>Barring revolutionary change, the world will experience catastrophic climate change that may bring about the extinction of our species.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&quot;The dictatorship of the proletariat is not a change of government, but a new state, with new organs of power, both central and local: it is the state of the proletariat, which has arisen on the ruins of the old state, the state of the bourgeoisie.&quot; - J.V. Stalin</p></blockquote><h2><a name='header-n33' class='md-header-anchor '></a>How Marxism-Leninism has solved a Previous Existential Threat</h2><p>Following the October Revolution and subsequent civil war that led to the establishment of the Soviet Union, the USSR faced the immediate prospect of building socialism in a deeply underdeveloped society. In 1925, while the US and Western Europe had already industrialized, many parts of the Soviet Union were living in a manner largely unchanged from medieval feudalism. 90% of crops were sown by hand. Virtually no heavy industry existed. Illiteracy was rampant, especially among women, of whom less than 15% could read and write. </p><p>While the poverty of the Soviet people was bad enough on its own, the underdevelopment of the economy presented an existential threat to the society itself. Western powers conspired to destroy the revolution, having already invaded during the Russian Civil War. Britain and the United States refused to recognize the Soviet government and actively supported hostile internal elements. In 1933, with the rise of the Nazis in Germany, this threat was magnified significantly. Hitler had long planned on invading the Soviet Union, annhilating and enslaving its population, and elminating what he called &quot;Judeo-Bolshevism&quot; from the world. Germany was far more technologically advanced than the Soviets, and had an industrial base established for over a century, making their hostility an existential threat. </p><p>In order to survive this threat, the Soviet Union would have to accomplish in 10 years what had taken the capitalist West 100 years to build (to make no mention of imperialism and slavery&#39;s super-exploitation). It was through the principles of democratic centralism, collectivization, and Marxism-Leninism that the Soviet Union was able to accomplish this monumental task.</p><p>The eventual defeat of the Nazi war machine by the Soviet Union is a testament to the success of Soviet Five-Year Plans. From 1928 to 1940, the Soviets were able to massively increase agricultural output, build a heavy industry sector to rival any western country and increase the standard of living for the vast majority of Soviet citizens. It did all this in the face of internal and external political opposition, and the communist mass movement was able to grow significantly stronger as a result of these plans. The level of support for Soviet policy and a recognition of the need to re-order society for the benefit of all can be seen in the heroism and sacrifice of millions of Soviet soldiers and civilians in their war against the invading fascists.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&quot;At the risk of seeming ridiculous, let me say that the true revolutionary is guided by a great feeling of love. It is impossible to think of a genuine revolutionary lacking this quality.&quot; - Che Guevara</p></blockquote><h2><a name='header-n48' class='md-header-anchor '></a>A Vision of Life Beyond Climate Change</h2><p>While climate change does confront us with a threat to our entire civilization, we must not abandon hope. The environmental catastrophes we face are far from insurmountable, and defeatism has spread not from a sober assessment of the facts but merely a lack of both imagination about the future and the will to challenge the existing power structures that profit from the degradation of our ecosystem. If we can imagine a world governed not by the private tyranny of multinational corporations and bourgeois politicans but by its people through democratic centralism and collectivization, and we have the will to do what is necessary to supress and eradicate the capitalist class, then reversing climate change is no longer a pipe dream. It would be entirely within our power to build a sustainable world on which all life can flourish, free from the threat of impending ecological destruction, the capitalist class, then reversing climate change is no longer a pipe dream. Though climate change does confront us with a threat to our entire civilization, we must not abandon hope. The environmental catastrophes we face are far from insurmountable, and defeatism has spread not from a sober assessment of the facts but merely a lack of both imagination about the future and the will to challenge the existing power structures that profit from the degradation of our ecosystem. </p><p>However, overthrowing capitalism and ushering in a transitional socialist phase will not be enough to guarantee our survival. We must also have a measured, rational and well-critiqued plan to radically change our relationship with our one, and only, planet.</p><p>By eradicating the parasitic lifestyle of the the Imperial Core and its beneficiaries we can deliver a high quality of life to all people of the world while simultaneously restoring health to our fragile ecosystems. Crafting this plan is an enormously ambitious project, and one that is vital to the survival of our species. In order for our children to live free of the suffering that accompanies a dying ecosystem, we must immediately begin the process of planning to restore our world.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&quot;It thus appears that the very qualities of big industry which, in our present-day society, produce misery and crises are those which, in a different form of society, will abolish this misery and these catastrophic depressions.&quot; -Friedrich Engels</p></blockquote><h2><a name='header-n65' class='md-header-anchor '></a>Our Assumptions</h2><p>In order to accomplish the agenda that will ultimately be put forth in our 5 year plan we must have a complete re-organization of society.</p><p>We are not building a plan for revolution: such theory is derived from practice. Many comrades on the ground are already doing excellent work to further that aim. Instead, we look ahead to the future when we have gained state power. At that point, we can move into planning what has been laid out above. </p><p>Our assumptions for planning the stated are as follows:</p><ol><li><em>A revolution has already occurred and enjoys overwhelmingly popular and political support.</em></li><li><em>We have uncontested access to the resources necessary to execute the plan (monetary, coercion if necessary).</em></li><li><em>We have removed the traditional barriers to international cooperation by eliminating the drivers of Western imperialism, both military and economic.</em></li></ol><p>Five year plans have historical precedent for large scale planning. It is a reasonable time frame in which to work, allowing us to flexibly respond to new developments while also ensuring that we can stay focused on long-term goals. This places us in stark contrast to bourgeois society, which is incapable of thinking past the next earnings report or election cycle. We have also projected this plan five years into the future. While it is ambitious to assume that we can gain state power in such a short time, it is important to remember that revolutionary gains often occur much more quickly than anticipated, especially in times of acute crisis or existential threat. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&quot;It took the madmen of yesterday for us to be able to act with extreme clarity today. I want to be one of those madmen. We must dare to invent the future.&quot; -Thomas Sankara</p></blockquote><h2><a name='header-n83' class='md-header-anchor '></a>The Plan for the Mitigation and Reversal of Climate Change</h2><p>Our organization is focused on providing a detailed report, grounded in historical materialism, on what steps will be necessary to overcome climate change and to ensure that the power structures that have inflicted it upon us are thoroughly destroyed in the process. Our document will be one of class war, because it is only in the final destruction of capitalism that we can ensure the survival of our species. We will make all data available for critique. </p><p>Additionally, we will demonstrate how labor can be reorganized to meet this goal. We will make reasonable assumptions about available technology, while acknowledging that only a political and economic solution will solve our climate problem. There will be no technological utopianism, no advocacy for unrealistic geoengineering solutions, and all of our proposals will be thoroughly and demonstrably grounded in scientific research.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><em>&quot;I began revolution with 82 men. If I had to do it again, I would do it with 10 or 15 and absolute faith. It does not matter how small you are if you have faith and plan of action.&quot; - Fidel Castro</em></p></blockquote><h2><a name='header-n100' class='md-header-anchor '></a>An Appeal For Help</h2><p>Reversing the pending climate catastrophe is the single most important struggle in human history. It will require people of all backgrounds and from all parts of the world to come together in an unprecedented endeavor in order to successfully overcome it. We must not fail; the cost of failure is <em>extinction</em>. If you are as sickened as we are by the inaction and indifference of the global elite to the suffering of billions, we need your rage and passion channeled into our effort.  Together, we can bring to birth a new world from the ashes of the old.</p><p><em>¡Hasta la victoria siempre!</em></p><p>The Climate Stalin Community</p></div>
